Welcome to my space on the Internet.

## Features for Developers

For Developers, here are a few features of this website that may be interesting to you...

_**Integrated with Graph CMS**_  
GraphCMS is a headless CMS. If you have dynamic content that you want to control externally then graphCMS is great. No hassle, easy to pick up, reliable, and wonderful API playground.


_**Youtube Style Filter Tags**_  
Youtube's filter tags look cool. I wanted something like that. Using tailwindCSS and react states meant it was a piece of cake to make.

_**Plausible Analytics**_  
This site has plausible anayltics. It provides basic information about site traffic. No creepy heatmaps. It is simple to set up, simple to add and the billing plan doesn't fell like a trap.
