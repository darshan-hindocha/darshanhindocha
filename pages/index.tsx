                    Currently (as of 30/03/2022), the blog page and blogs are ready. I&apos;ve been looking forward to
                    having this space for a while. I tried medium, but it didn&apos;t hit the spot.

                    The direction and topics of the blog are loose for now. My general hope is to increase writing
                    proficiency, and deepen an understanding of concepts through writing about them.

                    More importantly, writing provides a compelling reason to be more thoughtful.

                    There will soon be book notes and an art gallery.
