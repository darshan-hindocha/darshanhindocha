I read the biggest bluff by Maria Konnikova in 2020, and it shook me up. Maria is a great writer. She perfectly balances the inclusion and omission of nitty-gritty details to keep things interesting and engaging. And, she is a great storyteller.

The following points are derived from first-hand observation. But my eyes were open to them because of the biggest bluff. I play no money poker on pokernow where the stakes are season rankings. Not as compelling as money, maybe.

### Fold regularly and with pride
I am very happy to fold after putting a lot of chips in the pot. I don’t have clear rules for when I should or shouldn’t fold but the folding itself doesn’t bother me. Even if my hand turns out to be winning after I exit.

The thinking behind this is simple, being able to cut your losses is crucial.  I may not have clear exit rules but it is a shame to incur further losses by fear of losing sunk costs. Poker lets me practice dropping sunk costs when making decision.

### Fold or Raise but don’t Call
There are certain times when I feel I have a weak hand. If someone raises the bets on the round and I have to decide how to proceed, I will typically fold or raise but not call. It is kind of clear why I would fold. The reasoning behind raising instead of calling is more interesting.

Let me paint a picture. Eight person table. Flop has been dealt. I have a low pair with the flop. There is one higher and one lower card than my pair in the flop. There are three people still active. The first person raises by 1 big blind, the next person calls.

I would raise most of the time here. I wouldn’t raise if there were too many people still active. I might still raise if I didn’t have a pair, and only a high card or chances of a flush or straight. But I’m careful about staying in betting rounds by chances of flushes or straights.

### Detach outcomes from actions
A good play or series of decisions can lead to losing massively, and a terrible play can lead to winning big. When introspecting on previous plays it is important to remember this. Introspecting and learning from previous plays is about bringing to light the decision making process involved and looking for sloppy thinking.
