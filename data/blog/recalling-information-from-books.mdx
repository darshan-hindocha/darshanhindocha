## A complementary and time-efficient recall process for audiobooks

## The experience
As you listen to an audiobook you typically experience emotions. When something is impactful; in a positive way, negative way, for its novelty or excitement, you feel strong emotions in that moment of listening.  Those emotions and the ideas in the audiobook attach themselves to the particular point on the journey in which you experienced them.

So, if you are listening to chapter 2 of your audiobook whilst walking alongside the Big Ben. Then days later, you can recall the contents of chapter 2 by thinking about the Big Ben. And alternatively, when you read or think about chapter 2, the experience of walking around Big Ben will come back to you.

Listening to audiobooks while walking provide a weirdly vivid moment, where you can clearly see the walk in your minds eye and recall the idea from the book, and how it made you feel. I experience a strong pull to write these ideas down somewhere before they get lost or forgotten. But it can be frustrating to interrupt the audiobook and those special moments just to capture them in writing.

## The Semi-Solution
A semi-solution that I think is particularly effective is to;
	1. Finish the audiobook — listen to it while walking or cycling, but in an environment that changes as you move so avoid tubes and treadmills (I’ll reason why later)
	2. Skim read the book, and copy notes of the things you don’t want to forget or lose into a separate text file.

Skim reading can be a long process but this is where the audiobook comes in. Quite remarkably when you skim read a part of the book you will remember the moments you experienced when listening to that part of the audiobook — you will see the street you were walking on, the feeling you experienced, the level of fear you felt of the idea escaping your working memory.

When you skim read you naturally recall the above information. And if you treat that information as a signal for how fast to skim and how much to skip forward, then you get through the content faster. At the same time you manage to capture the memorable ideas -- which I worry about losing otherwise.

Your brain recalls this info automatically when you skim read — it’s a fascinating experience, but it's something you have to experience for yourself.

So now the process of skim reading is narrowly focused on pulling the ideas that you found impactful and memorable from the book.

What are the benefits of skim reading and extracting notes after listening to the audiobook?
* It saves you from interrupting the audiobook, and,
* By listening to the audiobook and having the recalled information to hand you reduce the skim reading time

Complementary my dear Watson... as Sherlock Holmes would say.

## A word of caution
I find that little comes back to me from the parts of the audiobook I listened to on the tube. More generally when my surround scenery isn’t changing it’s hard to distinguish each moment from the next. And I'm left with weaker recall.

Recall won’t work if I don’t pay full attention during the audiobook. The collective recalled experience of the ideas, emotions and journey are amplified by how much attention and focus we give the experience. In other words, thoughts that distract us from the book result in blank spaces in our memory of the journey. It’s okay that this happens. Meditation trains the skill of focus and directed attention.
