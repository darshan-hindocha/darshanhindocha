## Context
This moment is unique. It has never occurred before. And it won't occur again. Wanna bet?

My brain changes it's state everytime I learn something new. So anything I learn today, in order for me to remember that tomorrow, means my brain had to change.

## What Changed in my Brain?

There are four basic steps in creating a memory.

### 1. Encoding
This is where sensory input is translated into neurological language.

### 2. Consolidation
Here the brain connects this neurological data with existing neural activity. This forms a pattern of associative neural connections -- a neural circuit. These neural circuits can live for decades.

### 3. Storage
The brain locks this information in by making enduring, long-lasting changes in neural architecture. Other fancy changes happen in the brain's neuroanatomy and neurochemistry. The hippocampus plays an important role in forming consciously held memories because that is where neurogenesis happens -- the birth of new neurons.

### 4. Retrieval
Retrieval is about getting the information out. To do this you activate the neural circuit that you formed in the consolidation phase. Which allows you to recall, revisit, reminisce, etc. on a 'memory'
